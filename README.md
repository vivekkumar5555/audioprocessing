This readme provides an overview and instructions for using the audio processing functionality in your project. Audio processing involves manipulating and modifying audio signals to improve their quality, extract useful information, or add creative effects. This can be achieved through various techniques such as filtering, equalization, noise reduction, and more.

Features

Filtering : Apply various filters such as low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and notch filters to shape the frequency response of the audio signal.

Equalization : Adjust the frequency balance of the audio by boosting or attenuating specific frequency ranges.

Noise Reduction : Reduce unwanted background noise or hiss from the audio signal to enhance its clarity.

Pitch Shifting : Change the pitch of the audio signal to make it higher or lower without affecting the playback speed.

Time Stretching : Modify the duration of the audio signal while maintaining its pitch, allowing for tempo adjustments.

Effects : Apply creative effects like reverb, delay, chorus, or distortion to add depth and character to the audio. Installation To use the audio processing functionality in your project, follow these steps:

Install Dependencies : Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. This may include audio processing libraries such as Librosa, PyDub, or Essentia. Refer to the project documentation for specific requirements.

Import the Library : Import the audio processing library into your project. Depending on the programming language or framework you are using, this can be done through an import statement or by adding the library as a dependency in your project configuration.

Load and Process Audio : To process audio, load the audio file into your program using the provided functions or methods. Apply the desired audio processing techniques, such as filtering, equalization, or effects, to modify the audio signal. Make sure to follow the library's documentation and guidelines for proper usage of the provided functions.

Save or Output the Processed Audio : Once the audio processing is complete, save or output the processed audio file. This can be done by using the library's provided functions or methods to write the processed audio data to a file or play it back in real-time.
